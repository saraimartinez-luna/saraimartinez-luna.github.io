	  <p>The purpose was to assess student perception of parental engagement in the transition to college and how that impacts them while navigating college. The goal is to Identify trends related to gender, race/ethnicity, first-gen, definition of parent, living arrangement, perception of engagement prior to starting college, and birth order. They surveyed 219 incoming, first-year, and second-year students. All participants were at least 18 years of age, traditionally-aged college students (graduating from high school no more than 3 years ago), and students in the College of Education and Human Ecology at The Ohio State University. Selected students were asked to complete an online survey using Qualtrics about their attitudes and perceptions related to parental engagement with academic activities, university personnel, and non-academic activities. Each anonymous survey had 40 Likert-scale questions and 10 demographic multiple-choice questions.</p>

	  <h2><u>A Dream I had</u></h2>
	  <p>I was on my way to school in the morning. I could tell I was still early, but I had this fear the whole time that I was running late. I made my way to the parking garage when I saw someone I recognized drive towards me in their car. They seemed so lost and asked for directions to get out of the parking lot. I tried explaining where to go and soon realized they were not following along with me, so I got in the back of the car and figured I would just show them the way. As I finished giving directions, I noticed my car was not in the parking space that I had left it in the night before. I tried calling my dad to ask him about it, but he never answered, so I just texted him instead. As I looked up from my phone, I realized the car had not stopped moving the entire time. I looked around and no longer recognized where I was. I asked the driver if they could take me back to the parking garage. They stopped quickly at a yield sign and hurried me out saying that they were running late to work and couldn't take me back. The end.</p>
