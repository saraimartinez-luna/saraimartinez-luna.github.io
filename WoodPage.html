  <h1>Woodwind Instruments</h1>
   These instruments create sound when wind passes through a hole or reed (thin strip of material, used in mouthpiece) to create vibrations that produce sound. Not all woodwind instruments are made of wood, some like the saxaphone, which also belongs to the brass family, are woodwinds becasue they use a reed.

  <h1>Subgroups</h1>
    <ol>
     <li>Flutes</li>
      <ul>
       <li>Produce sound when air is blown into it and moves through the body. The instrument has holes all up and down its body, that when covered/uncovered, manipulate the air moving through it to produce various notes.</li>
       <li>Also known as Aerophones</li>
       <li style=font-size:large;>Flutes, Piccolo, Recorder, Irish Flute</b></li>
      </ul>
     <li>Reed</li>
      <ul>
       <li>Require a reed that vibrates as air passes through it to produce sound. Notes are manipulated through holes in the body in the same manner as flutes. </li>
       <li style=font-size:large;>Clarinet, Bassoon, Oboe, Bagpipes</li>
